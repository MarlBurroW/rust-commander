# RUST COMMANDER

RustCommander is an admin tool allowing to control and monitor your Rust server from Slack/Discord.

## Features

- Watch your Rust server chat and talk with your players from Slack/Discord.
- Receive notifications when a chat message matchs with a custom list of word (example "admin" or "cheater")
- Watch your Rust server logs from Slack/Discord (very verbose).
- Interact with your Rust server console from Slack/Discord.
- Auto-reconnect when the RCON/Slack/Discord connection is lost.

## Prerequistes

- Nodejs and NPM must be installed on the host machine.
- WebRcon must be enabled on the target Rust server.
